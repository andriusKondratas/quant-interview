Task Requirements:

    Monitor a configurable directory for new files
    Batch of files frequently copied to the directory by a third-party utility.
    Files might take time to being fully copied to the directory.
    Reads the contents of these files and extracts relevant data. (The expected file format is CSV (sample provided below))
    Each file contains records of network connections, with fields like timestamp, source/destination IP, domain.
    Ensures duplicate records within each batch of files are not processed.
    Discovers top 10 domains reported every 1 minute (Aggregation on connections count)
    Writes discovered tops into a txt file (sample provided below)
